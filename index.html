<h2>A list of HTML styles</h2>

<div>

	<p>There are many different types of HTML styles, 
	and they can be applied to a webpage in many different ways.</p>

	<p>To begin with, however, it’d be prudent to first define what <em>style</em> means when used in the
	 context of HTML web pages. The style element of an HTML web page determines the non-text 
	 selections of a website, this can be anything from the font type, to the background color, 
	 to even the alignment of various objects in the web page, from images to the text inside 
	 of a table to tables themselves.</p>
	 
	 <p>Style elements can be applied to an entire page or to parts of a page. 
	 They can be applied individually to separate tags or, using CSS also known as <q>Cascading Style Sheets</q>, they can be applied to all 
	 the instances of a particular tag.</p>
	 
	 <p>CSS is a file type that can be used to apply style to the entierty of an HTML page.</p>
	 	 
	 <blockquote STYLE = "border-left-style: solid; border-left-color:powderblue; border-left-width: 5px">
	 
	 <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the
	 presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone 
	 technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]
	 
	 </p>
	 
	 <div STYLE = "font-size: 10px">
	 
	 <p>Source: en.wikipedia.org</p>
	 
	 </div>
	 
	 </blockquote>
	 	 
	 <p>This CSS code can either be added manually to the head of 
	 an HTML document, or it can be linked to using a CSS file, provided that the CSS file is in 
	 a position to be read by the HTML file.</P>	 
	 
	 <p>Style elements can also be applied to &lt;div&gt; elements, and they can be used to create spaces where the style is different from that to the rest of the page. Many HTML pages make great use of different styles. This page certainly has them; perhaps you can see where they’ve been applied.</p>
 
	 <p>Below we will talk about the different types of styles, as well as their differing influences on a web page.</p>

<h3>Types of Styles</h3>

<p>There are many types of styles, apparent everywhere across the internet.
They don't all have the same popularity, but they're everywhere across the internet.
However, for this page, we'll limit the topic to be about common styles.</P>

<pre class = "tab" STYLE = "font-family:Times New Roman">Styles can roughly be thought of as applying to the visible portions of a webpage, whether that be the text or an image or a table. And styles can be used both to affect the objects in a page as well as the background. For instance, there are styles that
determine the font and size of the text you are reading. There are also styles
that affect the<br>                 spacing<br>                               and<br>                                          positioning of text as well.</pre>

<p>From paragraphs to line breaks to image wrapping, ctyles are an intgral part
of making the web human readable. Even <em>this</em> page is full of styles.
Can you find all of them?</p>
